*A simple (temporary store) movie collection app, where users can add, list and search for movies.*

Code was refactored like suggested in lecture 57.

Search function has 2 more features:
- search is not case sensitive (transforms search term and movie title with `.lower()` to lower case)
- if search can't find the movie, display message that movie was not found
